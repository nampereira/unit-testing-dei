# Introduction

In this section we provide some pointers into more advanced software engineering practices that take software testing even further. We also list some relevant selected material that we recommend for further reading.

# Advanced Practices

### Test Driven Development

Test driven development prescribes the use of tests to drive development. It refers to the practice of writing tests before any other code; that is, each new feature starts with the coding of a test, then the actual code is written. Doing this forces the developer to focus on design and analysis prior to coding, and also reduces the amount of code written as developers work towards making the minimum amount of code that passes the test.

### Behavior Driven Development

Behavior driven development extends test driven development by specifying requirements using a semi-formal format that allows to concentrate on the behaviour rather than on the implementation making it easier and faster to validate the application \(i.e. check if we are building the right thing\).

# Books

### Pragmatic Unit Testing in Java with JUnit

This is a major reference used in this document, and contains the essence of unit testing in Java, why you should do it and how. The more recent "**Pragmatic Unit Testing in Java 8 with JUnit**" updates its contents, but the core of both books is common and still relevant. _Highly recommended_.

### **How Google Tests Software**

This is a very interesting overview of how testing is performed at the scale of Google, and how they created a culture of testing that is widely viewed as the gold standard in the industry.

# On the Web

### **JUnit Best Practices**

Another major reference of this document. Collects a good number of good practices for Java and JUnit.

### Unit Tests, How to Write Testable Code and Why it Matters

This is a great summary about unit test.

### Testing Strategies in a Microservice Architecture

Presentation discussing testing strategies in applications composed of multiple independent components \(i.e. a Microservice Architecture\). It discusses several testing strategies in a well-structured and easy to understand manner.
